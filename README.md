This study aims to investigate the factors influencing the formation of advice-giving relationships within a consulting company's workplace network. Using the Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM), we analyze network data from 44 employees across offices in the United States and Europe.

The main objectives of this research are:

1. To identify which employees play a significant role in the advice network.

2. To determine which employee characteristics, such as gender, rank, and geographical location, influence the likelihood of forming advice-giving relationships.

3. To explore whether homophily (similarity between individuals) or heterophily (differences between individuals) exists in the advice network.

Through this research, we aim to provide insights into improving workplace network efficiency and communication by identifying key factors that influence the creation of advice relationships.
